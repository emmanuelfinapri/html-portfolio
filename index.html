    <h2>I am a Web Developer</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I am a Developer currently on a journey to becoming a full-stack
      developer. I have acquired a strong foundation in backend technologies,
      including Node.js, Express, and JavaScript, through training with Axia
      Africa. Now, Iâ€™m expanding my skills on the frontend side, focusing on
      HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while taking "The Complete 2024 Web Development
      Bootcamp." This portfolio is a reflection of my progress, showcasing what
      I've learned so far with HTML as I continue to grow and enhance my
      expertise.
