    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Emmanuel! I am a passionate developer with a diverse set of
      interests and skills. My journey into "Tech" began with learning backend
      development using Express.js and Node.js. Over time, I built a backend
      blog application and worked on various projects, including a capstone
      project focused on advancing internet access with 5G innovations in the
      university.
    </p>

    <p>
      My learning journey extends to frontend development as well, where I am
      currently exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through a comprehensive web
      development bootcamp. I enjoy working on projects that combine my
      technical expertise with my creative side.

      with me on GitHub or LinkedIn to learn more about my work and projects.
